# TRANSACTIONS_FRAUD_DETECTION

This project is an implementation of a Fraud Detection System using a Decision Tree algorithm, built with Python's scikit-learn library. It features a web interface created with Flask, allowing users to interactively predict and analyze fraudulent activities in financial transactions.

The Decision Tree model is trained on a dataset containing historical transaction data, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The model learns patterns from this data, enabling it to predict fraud in new transactions.
